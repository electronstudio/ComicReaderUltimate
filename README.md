ComicReaderUltimate (CRU) is the modern sucessor to ComicReaderPro, one of the earliest programs for reading comics in CBR, CBZ or JPEG format on Windows, Mac and Linux.

* Multi-threaded for fast loading
* GPU accelerated rendering
* View single or double pages
* View pages separately or in a continuous scroll

CRU is highly configurable - you can tweak values to find the most natural reading experience.  However it is also highly opinionated.  It always runs fullscreen because that is best way to read comics.  There is no GUI because you are expected to learn the mouse and keyboard controls.  There is no file browser because your operating system should already have one.

TODO:
* a GUI to make configuration easier
* Android and iOS versions
* support drag-and-drop file opening on Mac (ComicReaderPro had it, so why doesn't CRU? Short answer: blame Apple. Long answer: blame Oracle.)
